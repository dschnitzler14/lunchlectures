At Lectures at Lunch, we believe in the power of community, diversity, and the joy of learning. Whether youâ€™re working from home, a stay-at-home parent, a student, or simply seeking new experiences, our free online lecture series is designed to bring women together from all walks of life to share knowledge, inspire each other, and forge meaningful connections. Our live sessions offer real-time interaction, allowing for engaging discussions and the opportunity to ask questions. Join us every Wednesday at 12pm (GMT) for a 20-minute presentation followed by a 20-minute discussion, and become part of a vibrant, inclusive, and judgement-free community.
