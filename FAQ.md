# How do I join?
Navigate to the home page and click the link "Join Today's Lecture". This will take you to a "Google Meet" call, where you can join even if you don't have a google account. Note, this link will only appear on Wednesdays when a lecture is taking place.

# Who can join?
Absolutely anybody. While the focus of this lecture series is for women, by women, that absolutely does not mean that only women can join. All genders are are welcome to sit in for the lecture! 

# Is it free?
Yup! 100% free and always will be!

# What can I expect?
- Short answer: A short 20ish minute talk on a different topic every week, followed by a 20ish minute discussion of the topic. 
- Slightly longer answer: The host will introduce the speaker and the presentation, the speaker will present for approximately 20 minutes, followed by a 20 minute session of discussion and questions. This is not a test or supposed to grill the speaker, but a genuine discussion. This will be semi-moderated ([see safety](#where-we-draw-the-line--safety)), depending on the audience size and engagement.

# Will the lectures be recorded?
In most cases, yes, if the speaker has given their consent, then the lecture will be recorded and availble to view on the website/ youtube. However, this consent may be withdrawn at any point by the speaker. In addition, the subsequent discussion session **WILL NOT** be recorded, unless otherwise stated, in exceptional circumstances. In the event that we do record the discussion, then all members of the call will be informed prior to the call starting. The host of the call (i.e. one of us from Lectures at Lunch) will clearly state when the recording is starting and ending. 

# Why should I be a speaker?
There are a number of great reasons to want to present: 
- Public Speaking Practice: Use this platform to practice and hone your public speaking skills. If you want to receive feedback on your presentation, you can tell us beforehand! 
- CV Enhancement: Add this experience to your CV, showcasing your commitment to public engagement and continuous learning.
- Networking Opportunities: Meet and connect with women from different fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and support.

# I want to be a speaker!
Fantastic! We welcome speakers from any background, regardless of your level of experience - you just need to be passionate about your subject. That means students all way up to professors can present, but it's not just limited to academics! If you are a professional outside of academia, we also welcome your talk! Please email us at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}) to register your interest!

# How to prepare for a talk
Your presentation should be approximately 20 minutes long. Slides are optional and an optional powerpoint template is available here. Also be prepared for questions. Remember, this is not an exam so it's okay to say "I don't know!". The target audience are educated individuals who aren't experts in your field. So you might want to explain things that are obvious to you.

# What should I talk about?
A topic within your field and area of expertise! It can be a broad topic, or a more targeted view of something. Some examples:

- How does X work?
- Here is something about X you have never thought about
- Why X is important
- My research into X

# What we need from the speaker
If you are chosen or invited to be one of our lovely speakers, we would ask for a brief outline of the talk (2-3 sentences) and, if you have an online presence, a link to you where people can find you. In order to introduce you properly, we would also love a short paragraph or bulleted list of your bio with whatever you think is relevant!

# Where we draw the line & safety
We recognise that people from all walks of life will be joining us - at least that is what we are aiming for! However, we are also aware that this could lead to some friction between participants. While we encourage healthy and respectful discussion, we will absolutely not tolerate harrassment, bullying, verbal abuse, or insults. If, as a participant, you feel someone has crossed a line that the moderator/ host has not addressed appropriately, please let us know in the call's chat. It is very important to us that the space feels inclusive and judgement-free. As such, anyone joining a discussion or presenting a talk in bad faith will immediately be removed from the call. Repeat offenders may be banned from joining in the future.

# I want to join the Lectures at Lunch team!
Great! But: there is no money in this. This is entirely a labour of love, so I'm afraid there is no compensation, but for the warm fuzzy feeling of doing something cool. If that is okay with you, then the good news is that this is absolutely a CV booster! We're always looking for people to help out and support, so if you are interested in doing so, please email use at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}})!

At the moment, I have used "us" and "we" throughout this website and on socials. I am not trying to trick you or make you think that this is a bigger enterprise than it actually is. It is more of a hopeful "us" as I would very much like some team members!

# Can I get an email reminder?
Yes! You can sign up to the mailing list [here](https://mailchi.mp/b281aadcfccb/subscribe-to-lectures-at-lunch), where you will get a monthly email outlining the upcoming talks. We promise - no spam!

# Feedback
... is very, very welcome! If you have any notes or comments or complaints, please let us know so we can improve. Or just shower us in complements! Either way,  email us [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
